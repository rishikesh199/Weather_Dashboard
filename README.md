# 🌤 Weather Insights Dashboard: Real-Time Multi-City Weather Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize real-time weather conditions, forecasts, and air quality for multiple locations using WeatherAPI data.

## Short Description / Purpose
The Weather Insights Dashboard provides a visually engaging and analytical view of weather data for 5–6 locations. It helps users monitor temperature, humidity, AQI, and forecast trends in a single interface. Ideal for weather analysts, travelers, and data enthusiasts.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for dashboard creation
- 📂 Power Query – API integration and data transformation
- 🧠 DAX – Calculated measures for dynamic visuals
- 🎨 Figma – Custom-designed backgrounds and color themes
- 🌐 WeatherAPI – Real-time weather data source

## Data Source
- Source: [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- Data includes:
  - Current temperature and conditions
  - 7-day forecast
  - Air Quality Index (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, O3)
  - Sunrise & Sunset timings
  - Chances of rain per day
## Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem
Weather data is often scattered and hard to interpret quickly. Users need a consolidated, interactive dashboard that not only shows real-time metrics but also visually adapts to changing conditions for better decision-making.

### • Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a dynamic, visually appealing tool that:
- Displays real-time weather and AQI for multiple locations.
- Provides interactive options for location selection.
- Uses conditional formatting to make insights intuitive (e.g., color changes based on AQI levels or sunrise/sunset times).
- Helps users plan activities and monitor environmental conditions effectively.

### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals
- **Current Weather Card:** Shows temperature and condition with color-coded backgrounds for different weather states.
- **Location Selector:** Dropdown or button-based navigation to switch between cities (e.g., Mumbai, Andheri, Lonavala).
- **7-Day Forecast (Line Chart):** Displays temperature trends for the upcoming week.
- **Air Quality Index (Gauge + Metrics):**
  - Dynamic color changes based on AQI category (Good = Green, Moderate = Yellow, Poor = Red).
  - Pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, O3) displayed with green dots that turn yellow/red if values exceed thresholds.
- **Sunrise & Sunset Panel:** Icons and text with conditional color formatting to highlight day/night transitions.
- **Chances of Rain (Bar Chart):** Horizontal bars showing rain probability for each day, with color intensity increasing as chances rise.
- **Additional KPIs:** Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, UV Index—all styled for quick readability.

### • Impact & Insights
- **Travel Planning:** Helps users choose best days for trip
- **Health Awareness:** AQI insights for sensitive groups
- **Decision Support:** Useful for event organizers and outdoor businesses
